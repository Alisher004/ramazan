<h2>Briefly about me</h2>
<section>
<p>
   <strong>I, Rakhatbekov Almaz,</strong>  was born in 1993 in the Jumgal district. I received my secondary education from Lyceum No. 93 and received a specialized vocational education. I also studied a little bit of Sharia law. I started my career at the Military Commissariat, where I worked for a while.</p>
    <p>Currently, I install and maintain a cash register for "Microinvest". I also work in a taxi service, try to support my family, and I am studying online, which I have long dreamed of, namely, at the "Okurmen Learning Center" in a distance learning course in programming.</p>
    <p>There are four children in the family: two daughters and two sons. One son and one daughter study at school. My wife has a higher education in Sharia (fiqh).</p>
